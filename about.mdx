# About

This is the about page written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

It also supports syntax highlighting for code, here is a little React component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet-async";

module.exports = ({ user }) => (
	<div>
		<Helmet>
			<title>Page Title</title>
			<link rel="canonical" href="http://mysite.com/example" />
		</Helmet>
	</div>
);
```
